# Prototype Park and Ride web application:

Current Features:
* Mock login and sign up screen.
* Example application appearance.
* Has a current location and a destination setting.
* Mobile friendly UI (just short of styling).

Caveats:
* You can use any username/email and password to `login`.
* The location is set to a pre-defined route so currently not able to set any location yet.
* Currently most of the dropdown information is hard-coded so information displayed on map and dropdown may not be accurate.

1. Clone this repository and open command line in the project directory.
